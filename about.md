This is the personal site of Johannes Braese.
Sometimes I write here about small side projects or things I find interesting. 

I work as a Senior Research Engineer at HERE Technologies in Berlin.
Previously, I was a freelance consultant in the field of geospatial data
science and worked in the Analytics team of the World Bank’s Global
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.

I hold two bachelor’s and one master’s degree. Specifically, I have a BSc
in Computer Science from Technical University of Berlin, a BSc in
Economics from the University of Mannheim, and a MSc in Environmental
Economics and Climate Change from the London School of Economics.

My GitHub account is [https://github.com/jbraese](jbraese).
