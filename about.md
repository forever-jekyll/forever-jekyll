This is a blog for Tony Loehr. This is a place for thoughts, musings, ideas, plans, and manifestos. I will be reguarly posting about including cybersecurity, crypto, investment, transfer pricing, and technological discourse. Expect esoteric content and the occational ecopunk rant.

Additional interests of mine include horror, film, trap metal, and story-driven game development. Contact me via my linked socials if you want to connect, share ideas, or otherwise scream into the void.

All opinions expressed here are my own.
