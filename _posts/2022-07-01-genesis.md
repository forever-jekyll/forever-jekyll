Genesis

As with all things, there comes a time where you reflect, on what has been done, what is being done and what is hoping to be done. That is has been the 
case with my life. Three years ago, I came up with a list. It was a long list of things I wanted to do. I named it 'The Polymath Map'. There were things like Technology, Art, Music, Languages, Sports and Miscellaneous for things that didn't fit in the previous categories. I picked a language, learnt a bit, lost interest and picked another one. 

I picked up an instrument and did the same. I'm changing all that and having a more stable way of approaching mastery of this. 

This is why I have decided to learn in public.

Welcome aboard the Ren Femina.
